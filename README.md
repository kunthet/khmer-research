**KhmerResearch.com** is an initiative to build the first AI-powered academic database for Cambodia. Our mission is to crawl Open Access research papers from global sources, synthesize them using Large Language Models (LLMs), and publish high-quality summaries in Khmer to bridge the language gap in higher education.

## 🚀 The Vision

Academic resources in the Khmer language are scarce. Most Cambodian students and researchers face a language barrier when trying to access global knowledge.

**The Solution:**
1.  **Crawl:** Aggregating Open Access papers (CC-BY) from ASEAN and Western repositories.
2.  **Synthesize:** Using AI to extract key insights, methodologies, and results.
3.  **Translate:** Generating "Strategic Review Reports" in Khmer, not just word-for-word translations.
4.  **Publish:** A centralized, searchable database for Khmer students.
